# Navigation System Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive navigation and topic page system for Math Farm. The system will enable users to navigate between different mathematical topics, access tools, and explore educational content with a seamless user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Topic Page Navigation

**User Story:** As a mathematics learner, I want to click on topic cards and navigate to dedicated topic pages, so that I can access detailed content and exercises for specific mathematical subjects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a topic card THEN the system SHALL navigate to `/topic/:id` route
2. WHEN a user visits `/topic/:id` THEN the system SHALL display the topic page with relevant content
3. WHEN a topic page loads THEN the system SHALL show topic title, description, prerequisites, and estimated time
4. WHEN a topic page loads THEN the system SHALL display mathematical expressions using MathJax
5. IF a topic has prerequisites THEN the system SHALL show prerequisite topics with navigation links
6. WHEN a user is on a topic page THEN the system SHALL provide breadcrumb navigation back to home

### Requirement 2: Tools Page Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access interactive mathematical tools, so that I can perform calculations and visualizations to support my learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/tools` THEN the system SHALL display a tools overview page
2. WHEN the tools page loads THEN the system SHALL show available tool categories
3. WHEN a user clicks on a tool category THEN the system SHALL navigate to the specific tool
4. WHEN a tool loads THEN the system SHALL provide interactive functionality
5. WHEN using tools THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design across devices

### Requirement 3: Educational Guide Pages

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to access LaTeX and MATLAB guides, so that I can learn these important mathematical tools alongside core mathematics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/latex-guide` THEN the system SHALL display LaTeX documentation
2. WHEN a user navigates to `/matlab-guide` THEN the system SHALL display MATLAB tutorials
3. WHEN guide pages load THEN the system SHALL show structured content with examples
4. WHEN viewing guides THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting for code examples
5. WHEN on guide pages THEN the system SHALL offer interactive examples where applicable

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Navigation UX

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive navigation throughout the platform, so that I can easily find and access the content I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL provide loading states
2. WHEN on any page THEN the system SHALL highlight the current navigation item
3. WHEN navigation fails THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support tab navigation and shortcuts
5. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly navigation

### Requirement 5: Search and Discovery

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to search for topics and content, so that I can quickly find specific mathematical concepts I want to study.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the search box THEN the system SHALL show real-time search suggestions
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching terms
3. WHEN a user selects a search result THEN the system SHALL navigate to the relevant content
4. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative topics
5. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL include topics, tools, and guide content

### Requirement 6: Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to track my progress through topics, so that I can see what I've completed and what to study next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes topic activities THEN the system SHALL mark topics as completed
2. WHEN viewing topic cards THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
3. WHEN a user returns to the platform THEN the system SHALL remember their progress
4. WHEN prerequisites are met THEN the system SHALL unlock advanced topics
5. WHEN viewing progress THEN the system SHALL suggest next recommended topics
