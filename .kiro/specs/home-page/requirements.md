2. WHEN tool demos are rendered THEN the system SHALL provide real-time interaction without requiring server requests
3. WHEN a user interacts with a demo THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and results
4. WHEN demos are displayed THEN the system SHALL include brief explanations of each tool's capabilities
5. WHEN a user wants to access full tools THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation to the tools page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a learner interested in practice, I want to see gamified examples with progress tracking, so that I can experience the platform's learning approach and feel motivated to continue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the practice section loads THEN the system SHALL display sample problems with gamification elements
2. WHEN a user interacts with practice examples THEN the system SHALL track progress using local storage
3. WHEN progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL display visual indicators like streaks or completion badges
4. WHEN practice problems are solved THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and step-by-step solutions
5. WHEN the section renders THEN the system SHALL maintain all gamification data locally without external dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a potential user on any device, I want the home page to be fully responsive and accessible, so that I can have an optimal experience regardless of my device or accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads on any device THEN the system SHALL meet Core Web Vitals performance standards with LCP under 2.5 seconds
2. WHEN the page is accessed THEN the system SHALL be fully compliant with WCAG 2.2 accessibility standards
3. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide clear focus indicators and logical tab order
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
5. WHEN the theme toggle is activated THEN the system SHALL seamlessly switch between light and dark modes
